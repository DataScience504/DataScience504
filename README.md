# Welcome to DataScience 504!

I'm a data enthusiast, just beginning my journey into the world of Data Analytics and Data Science. I created this space to share the work I'm doing along the way — on a never-ending path to support data-driven decision-making.

Although I currently have a full-time job in another field, I've always been closely connected to technology, working with large volumes of data, and designing solutions for various industrial challenges.

I have experience in data manipulation and cleaning, building visualizations in Power BI, and I'm steadily growing my skills in SQL and Python.

Feel free to explore the projects I’ll be sharing here as I continue learning and building!

# Projects:

## My firsts projects:
### Earthquake Visualization in Central America (1975–2025)
This project provides an interactive, visual exploration of earthquake activity in Central America over the last 50 years. Using data visualization tools like Folium and Pandas, we identify spatial patterns, seismic hotspots, and the most powerful earthquakes in the region.

### Lunar phase and birth rates — are they related?
In this project, we perform an exploratory analysis to determine whether there is any correlation between the lunar phase and the number of births.
The analysis includes date processing, astronomical lunar phase calculation, data visualization, and basic statistical testing.
