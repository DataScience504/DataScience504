# Welcome to DataScience504!

I'm a data enthusiast, just beginning my journey into the world of Data Analytics and Data Science. I created this space to share the work I'm doing along the way — on a never-ending path to support data-driven decision-making.

Although I currently have a full-time job in another field, I've always been closely connected to technology, working with large volumes of data, and designing solutions for various industrial challenges.

I have experience in data manipulation and cleaning, building visualizations in Power BI, and I'm steadily growing my skills in SQL and Python.

Feel free to explore the projects I’ll be sharing here as I continue learning and building!

# Projects:

## My firsts projects:
### Lunar phase and birth rates — are they related?
In this project, we perform an exploratory analysis to determine whether there is any correlation between the lunar phase and the number of births.
The analysis includes date processing, astronomical lunar phase calculation, data visualization, and basic statistical testing.
